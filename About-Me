Hi, you can just call me Doc if you wish.

I'm an aspiring software dev and have decided to go down the road of self-taught (eating the knowledge fruits of the internet tree).
I decided the best step to start my journey would be completing the EdX CS50 Course and seeing where I can go from there. Seemed a good 
place to start!

Always welcome help and critisim, so if you happen to be scouring over my code and spot a mistake or something to be improved on please 
let me know!
